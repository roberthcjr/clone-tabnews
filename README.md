# üß™ TabNews Clone with Professional Practices

This repository contains an implementation of [TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/), built with a strong focus on **software engineering best practices**, including:

- MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller)
- Test-Driven Development (**TDD**)
- Minimal use of frameworks
- Clean and modular code organization

> üöß Work in progress ‚Äî feedback, issues, and contributions are welcome!

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

This is more than just a clone. The goal is to **learn and apply real-world development practices** in a realistic and scalable project.

### üìê Clean Architecture

Built using the **MVC pattern**, which separates concerns and makes the application more maintainable and testable.

### ‚úÖ TDD in Practice

Every feature is developed using tests first. This ensures confidence in the code and serves as living documentation.

### üß© Framework-light Approach

Avoids heavy frameworks like Express or Next.js. The goal is to understand how each layer works by building with just the essentials of the Node.js stack.

### üß™ Automated Testing

Uses **Jest** to ensure robustness through unit and integration tests.
